🧱 1. Core Architecture (DONE or NEARLY DONE)
These are the foundations you’ve already built or are polishing:
✔ MongoDB database layer
- Clean CRUD functions
- Consistent return values
- Strong logging
- Password hashing
- Permissions stored per page
- User schema stabilised
✔ Login + Registration
- Username uniqueness
- Email validation
- Strong password rules
- bcrypt hashing
- Full user document returned on login
✔ MainApp navigation
- Dynamic page loading
- Permission‑aware navigation
- Read‑only mode support
- Profile Page receives full user document
✔ Profile Page
- Change password
- Update fields
- Strong validation
- MongoDB update functions working
You’ve already solved the hardest parts.

🧭 2. User Management & Admin Tools (IN PROGRESS)
This is where your app becomes useful for real users.
🔹 Admin Control Panel
- View all users
- Edit permissions
- Reset passwords
- Delete users
- Add new users manually
- View logs (optional)
🔹 Schema auto‑repair
When new fields are added (email, phone, theme), older users should be updated automatically.
🔹 Duplicate email check
Prevent multiple accounts using the same email.

🎨 3. UI/UX Enhancements (NEXT STEPS)
These are quality‑of‑life improvements that make the app feel polished.
🔹 Registration Page
- Add “Confirm Password”
- Add “Show Password” toggle
- Add password strength meter
- Add username availability check
🔹 Profile Page
- Editable fields (email, phone, theme)
- Save button with validation
- Optional avatar upload (if desired)
🔹 Navigation
- Highlight active page
- Group admin pages separately
- Add icons (optional)

🔐 4. Security & Validation (IMPORTANT)
You’re already doing well here, but here’s what’s left:
🔹 Case‑insensitive username lookup
So “Graham” and “graham” are treated the same.
🔹 Input sanitisation
Especially for email, username, and text fields.
🔹 Rate limiting (optional)
Prevent brute‑force login attempts.
🔹 Logging improvements
- Log failed logins
- Log permission changes
- Log admin actions

🧩 5. Page Framework (YOUR 4‑PAGE APP)
You mentioned wanting a 4‑page modular app.
Here’s the recommended structure:
1️⃣ Dashboard
- Welcome message
- Quick links
- User info summary
2️⃣ Data Page
- pyqtgraph / matplotlib integration
- pandas table
- MongoDB data queries
- Filters, sorting, export (optional)
3️⃣ Admin Page
- User management
- Permissions
- Logs
- Schema repair tools
4️⃣ Profile Page
- Change password
- Update email/phone/theme
- View permissions
- View role
This structure is clean, scalable, and easy to maintain.

🧪 6. Testing & Debugging (ONGOING)
Before calling the app “complete”, you’ll want:
🔹 Unit tests for database functions
- create_user
- update_password
- update_permissions
- delete_user
- get_user
🔹 UI tests
- Registration flow
- Login flow
- Permission‑restricted navigation
- Profile updates
- Admin actions
🔹 Error handling
- Missing fields
- Invalid input
- DB connection issues
- Permission denied

📦 7. Packaging & Deployment (FINAL STAGE)
When everything works:
🔹 Convert to executable
Using PyInstaller or fbs.
🔹 Config file
Store DB connection, theme, app settings.
🔹 Logging directory
Ensure logs are written to a safe location.
🔹 Optional:
- Auto‑update system
- Installer
- Splash screen
- Versioning

🚀 8. Future Enhancements (OPTIONAL BUT FUN)
Once the core app is stable:
🔹 Dark mode / themes
🔹 Multi‑language support
🔹 Role‑based UI hiding
🔹 Activity logs per user
🔹 Email notifications
🔹 Two‑factor authentication
🔹 API endpoints (Flask/FastAPI)

🎯 Where you are right now
You’re at a perfect point:
- Database layer is nearly clean
- Registration + login are solid
- Profile Page is functional
- Permissions system is working
- MainApp is almost fully correct
The next big wins are:
⭐ Finalising MainApp user passing
⭐ Completing Admin Page
⭐ Adding confirm password to registration
⭐ Adding case‑insensitive username lookup
⭐ Adding schema auto‑repair
Once those are done, your app becomes production‑ready.

If you want, I can now:
- Generate a complete roadmap checklist
- Build your Admin Page
- Add confirm password to registration
- Add case‑insensitive login
- Add schema auto‑repair
- Build your Dashboard Page
- Build your Data Page with pyqtgraph/matplotlib
Just tell me which direction you want to move next.
